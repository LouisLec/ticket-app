comment on function priv.tg__timestamps() is
  E'This trigger should be called on all tables with created_at, updated_at - it ensures that they cannot be manipulated and that updated_at will always be larger than the previous updated_at.';

-- Used for queueing jobs easily; relies on the fact that every table we have
-- has a primary key 'id' column; this won't work if you rename your primary
-- key columns.

comment on function priv.tg__add_job() is
  E'Useful shortcut to create a job on insert/update. Pass the task name as the first trigger argument, and optionally the queue name as the second argument. The record id will automatically be available on the JSON payload.';
